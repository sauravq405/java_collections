# Java Collections Framework Practice Project

Welcome to the Java Collections Framework Practice Project! This repository contains a sample Java project designed to help developers practice and explore the various interfaces and implementations of the Java Collections Framework, including `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, and `Map` hierarchies.

## Project Overview

This project includes example implementations and demonstrations of the following key components of the Java Collections Framework (up to Java 17):
- **Collection Hierarchy**: `List`, `Set`, and `Queue` with their respective implementations.
- **Map Hierarchy**: `Map` interface with its implementations and sub-interfaces like `SortedMap` and `ConcurrentMap`.

The goal is to provide hands-on experience with common collection classes such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `TreeSet`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`, along with understanding their use cases, performance characteristics, and thread-safety features.

## Features

- Example code for each major collection type.
- Demonstrations of basic operations (add, remove, iterate, etc.).
- Performance comparisons between different implementations.
- Thread-safe collection examples using `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
- Documentation of the collection hierarchies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or later (recommended).
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred IDE.
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle (optional, for dependency management).
